# WordPress HP Cloud CDN Plugin (Alpha)
WordPress HP Cloud CDN or OpenStack Shell Plugin Adds a Web Shell to the instance running WordPress to upload the objects to a container and run all OpenStack Python Client Commands. Compatible With All OpenStack installations except setups which do not support Python Client Tools.

This is an Alpha release.
This is release bears no credit as it is for testing vulnerabilities. All credits will be given. 
This does not uses the PHP library.
This uses OpenStack Python Clients.
This is not for the newbies. Mnimum idea about shell, OpenStack etc. is needed. It is a beutiful way to invite hacking attempts if used by a noob who has ssh access.
